# Amazone_clone
This is a static Amazon homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to recreate the visual structure of Amazon's home interface, including:

- Navigation bar and logo section  
- Search bar UI  
- Category menu  
- Product card grid  
- Footer content  
This project helped me improve my skills in layout structuring, box-model usage, flexbox, typography, and UI reproduction. It also enhanced my ability to rebuild real-world website components using clean and organized HTML/CSS.

Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3
